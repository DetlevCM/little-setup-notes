One of the joys but also blights of academia is an overabundance of literature in some disciplines.
This lead me to research solutions that could help me search trhough my local library to re-extract papers I had discovered earlier.

This solution had to be:
- free
- able to handle scanned documents without OCR (old papers)

What I eventually settled on, is OpenSemanticSearch: https://www.opensemanticsearch.org/

My personal preference is to use the Server Appliance Image and tweak the necessary settings to allow me to access it via my browser.

1) Set up port forwarding in VirtualBox to redirect to the VM and allow SSH access (TCP for both suffices)

2) Share index directory (read/write) and documents directory (read) with the VM

3) Adjust resource usage to your computer (yes its slow with less RAM, but it works).

Due to the academic route, I would call my documents directory papers - shared with the VM, this becomes /media/sf_papers internally. The index directory needs to be called index as per documentation and becomes /media/sf_index internally.

Once the VM is ready, the next steps are:

4) Create a symbolic link to the paper directory in /var/www/html and configure apache2.conf as well as add the apache2 user to the vboxsf user group to ensure it can access the files.

ln -s /media/sf_papers/ /var/www/html/papers

<Directory /var/www/html/papers>
      Options Indexes FollowSymlinks
      AllowOverride All
      Require all granted
</Directory>

usermod -a -G vboxsf www-data

5) Adjust the OpenSemanticSearch settings in connector files to ensure the documents can be served properly by adjusting /etc/opensemanti-search/connector-files .

config['mappings'] = { "/media/sf_papers": "http://127.0.0.1:8080/papers" }

config['facet_path_strip_prefix'] = [ "/media/sf_" ]
 
If you copy the connector-files from "outside" during setup filem make sure the permissions are correct - they should be 664.
(That was a weird problem to understand...)


For the most fundamental unsecured setup, this suffices. - Any details on OpenSemanticSearch can be found in the omnline documentation https://www.opensemanticsearch.org/doc/admin or the associated Github pages https://github.com/opensemanticsearch .
