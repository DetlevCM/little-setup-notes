In the context of scientific calculations, it can be useufl to run a 
scheduler on a local computer to allow the easy management of compute
tasks. With continuous developments and changes, the free job scheduler 
which is widely available seems to be the slurm scheduler, available 
in the repositories.

These notes are a reminder which quirks where encountered in a recent 
slurm configuration - 2021/02/20.
The operating sytem is openSUSE Tumbleweed.

- install slurm including the dependencies via zypper/yast
- configure a slurm instance using the web intferface available, for 
  example from for example https://slurm.schedmd.com/configurator.html
  (Documentation: https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html )

At this point, slumrmd can be started, slurmctld return an error.
A little bit of looking revealed that the default spool location had 
permission problems. Creating /opt/slurm/spool with permissions for 
slurm:slurm resovled these.
Care also needs to be taken to ensure that CPUs, cores, sockets and 
threads are correctly configured. 

While it used to be that slurm did not accept localhost as the IP 
addres configuration for the host/compute node , this now seems to be 
supported which is excellent news for single mqchine home users.
(This not tested with actual compute tasks at this point.)
